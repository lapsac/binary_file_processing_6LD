# binary_file_processing_6LD
The create method creates a binary file containing integers of type int. At first, the create method
enters the file name (with path) from the keyboard, followed by the amount of numbers and an integer
sequence. The numbers entered from the keyboard are recorded in a file by the create method.
• The view method outputs the contents of the file to the screen. At first, the view method is entered from the appropriate keyboard
filename (with path) and then outputs the contents of the file.
• The method changes the following menu in an infinite loop:
1) Creation
2) Calculate
3) View
4) About
5) Exit
The change method then inputs an integer from the keyboard. If the user entered 1, then the method
main calls the create method and uses it to create a file. If the user entered 2, then the method
main calls the calculate method. If the user entered 3, then outputs the contents of the specified file to the screen with
method view help. If the user entered 4, then the about method is called. But if the user
entered 5, then the program ends its work
